# Debugging & Performance Tools

## React DevTools

- Install the React DevTools browser extension (Chrome/Firefox).
- Use the Components and Profiler tabs to inspect component state, props, and performance.

## Linting & Formatting

- Run `npm run lint` to check for code quality issues.
- Run `npm run format` to auto-format code with Prettier.

## Dependency Checks

- Run `npm run audit` to check for security vulnerabilities.
- Run `npm run outdated` to see outdated dependencies.

## Performance Profiling

- Use the React Profiler (in DevTools) to identify slow components and unnecessary re-renders.
- Use Lighthouse (in Chrome DevTools) for overall performance and accessibility audits.

# Testing & Debugging

## Running Tests

- Run `npm test` to execute all unit and integration tests.
- Test files are located alongside their components (e.g., `ProductList.test.js`, `CartProduct.test.tsx`, `ErrorBoundary.test.jsx`).
- Tests cover loading, error, empty, and normal states for key components.

## Debugging

- Use React DevTools for inspecting component state and props.
- Use the Profiler tab in DevTools to analyze performance.
- Error boundaries are in place to catch and display UI errors gracefully.
- Check the browser console for error logs and stack traces.

## Common Issues

- If you see "Something went wrong" in the UI, an error was caught by the ErrorBoundary. Check the console for details.
- If tests fail, review the error message and stack trace for the failing test.

## Useful Scripts

- `npm run lint` ‚Äî Check code quality
- `npm run format` ‚Äî Auto-format code
- `npm run audit` ‚Äî Check for security vulnerabilities
- `npm run outdated` ‚Äî List outdated dependencies
